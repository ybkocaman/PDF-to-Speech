# PDF to Speech Converter

This Python script allows you to convert text from a PDF file to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library. It extracts text from the PDF and generates an audio file (in MP3 format) that you can listen to.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- PyPDF2
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install PyPDF2 gTTS
